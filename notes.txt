reading a binary file
	fopen(,"rb") and "wb"
determine how big the transmitted file is
	fseek, ftell, rewind (go to end of file, then find amount moved, reset to beginning)
read each byte into buffer
	char buffer []
	u_int32_t length
	u_int32_t bytesReceived = 0
	while (bytesReceived < length)
		bytesActuallyReceived = recv(sock, buffer + bytesReceived, length - bytesReceived)
		bytesReceived += bytesActuallyReceived
